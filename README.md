Hi, I'm Enis Musliu
============================

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a background in Computerized Automation and Robotics, currently building modern web and mobile applications using React.js, Next.js, and React Native. I've contributed to projects in e-commerce, education, and green tech, delivering responsive, high-performance user interfaces and collaborating closely with design and backend teams. While I'm new to .NET in my current role, I'm actively expanding my backend skills and learning Python independently to explore automation and AI. I've also worked on various freelance projects, gaining hands-on experience solving real-world problems and building complete solutions from scratch. Always learning, always building — with a strong focus on clean code, performance, and user experience.
